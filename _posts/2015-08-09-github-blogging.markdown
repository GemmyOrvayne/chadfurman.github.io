Are you looking for a new blogging platform?  Is WordPress, Tumblr, and others too clunky / hefty for your simple blog?  Make your blog beautiful and light-weight on Github Pages with Jekyll!

---------------

I assume you have / are familiar with the following:

* Node 
* Ruby Gems 
* Git 
* CSS/HTML 
* YAML 
* SASS 
* the command line

---------------

* Step 0: Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)
* Step 1: Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account (if you don't already have one) -- remember the name!  ;)
* Step 2: Create a repo named as follows: yourGitHubUserNameGoesHere.github.io
* Step 2a: If you created the repo via GitHub, clone it down
* Step 3: $ cd /path/to/cloned/yourGithubUserNameGoesHere.github.io
* Step 4: $ jekyll new .
* Step 5: commit (note: master branch displays) and push to the remote

---------------

At this point, http://yourGithubUserNameHere.github.io will be your blog!  Take a few moments to learn about Jekyll, creating posts, and making your own templates.

Enjoy!
